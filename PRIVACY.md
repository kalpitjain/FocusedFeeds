**Last Updated: October 26, 2025**

## Overview

FocusedFeeds is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy explains our practices regarding user data.

## Data Collection

**FocusedFeeds does not collect, store, transmit, or share any user data whatsoever.**

Specifically:

- ✅ No browsing history is recorded
- ✅ No user activity is tracked
- ✅ No analytics or telemetry is implemented
- ✅ No cookies are set

## How the Extension Works

FocusedFeeds operates entirely locally within your web browser. It:

1. **Injects CSS** to hide YouTube Shorts and Instagram Reels elements
2. **Runs JavaScript** to remove unwanted content from the page DOM

All processing happens **client-side** in your browser. Nothing leaves your device.
